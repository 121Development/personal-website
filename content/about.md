# About

121Eliasson is a personal blog about topics that interest me: Security, AI, Technology and Health.

I'm curious about the future and we are living in a super interesting time with a technological event horizon around the corner coupled with geopolitical shifts and an economy facing population decline and never ending QE.

I will try to post thought provoking ideas, personal takes and commentary on current events.

Let's enjoy the ride together!
