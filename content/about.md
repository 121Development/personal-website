# About

I help people and organisations stay safe and proactively navigate the current state of flux.

We have a technological event horizon around the corner coupled with geopolitical shifts and an economy facing population decline and never ending QE in our collective economic experiment.

Things are, and will get interesting.

## What I Do

My strength is understanding technology, people, and big picture events. I connect dots across domains and see patterns others miss.

Special skill: problem solving. Nothing is impossible.

## About This Website

This site is built with a minimal, performance-first approach.

### Tech Stack

- **Astro** - Static site generator that outputs pure HTML with zero client-side JavaScript by default
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge deployment across 300+ global locations
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe content management
- **Markdown** - Content stored as files in the repository

### Why This Stack

The philosophy is simple: **fast, secure, minimal**.

Astro generates static HTML at build time, eliminating runtime overhead. No database, no server-side rendering on each request, no JavaScript hydration delays. The result is near-instant page loads.

Cloudflare Workers serve content from edge locations worldwide, meaning the site loads quickly regardless of where you are. There's no origin server to wait for - everything is cached at the edge.

Markdown files in Git provide version control for all content. No CMS login, no database backups needed. Push a commit and it's live.

### SEO & Performance Optimizations

- **Core Web Vitals** - Optimized for LCP < 1.5s, zero CLS, minimal FID
- **Semantic HTML** - Proper heading hierarchy, structured data (JSON-LD)
- **Open Graph & Twitter Cards** - Rich previews when shared on social media
- **GEO Distribution** - Cloudflare edge caching ensures fast load times globally
- **No render-blocking resources** - Inline critical CSS, no external stylesheets
- **Preconnect hints** - Early connection to required origins
- **Robots & AI-friendly** - Configured for search engines and AI crawlers (GPTBot, Claude-Web)

The entire site weighs under 50KB per page including all assets. No tracking scripts, no cookie banners, no third-party requests.
