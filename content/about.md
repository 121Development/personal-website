# About

121Eliasson is a personal blog about topics that interest me: Security, AI, Technology and Health.

I'm curious about the future and we are living in a super interesting time with a technological event horizon around the corner coupled with geopolitical shifts and an economy facing population decline and never ending QE.

I will try to post thought provoking ideas, personal takes and commentary on current events.

Let's enjoy the ride together!

## About This Website

This site is built with a minimal, performance-first approach.

### Tech Stack

- **Astro** - Static site generator that outputs pure HTML with zero client-side JavaScript by default
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge deployment across 300+ global locations
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe content management
- **Markdown** - Content stored as files in the repository

### Why This Stack

The philosophy is simple: **fast, secure, minimal**.

Astro generates static HTML at build time, eliminating runtime overhead. No database, no server-side rendering on each request, no JavaScript hydration delays. The result is near-instant page loads.

Cloudflare Workers serve content from edge locations worldwide, meaning the site loads quickly regardless of where you are. There's no origin server to wait for - everything is cached at the edge.

Markdown files in Git provide version control for all content. No CMS login, no database backups needed. Push a commit and it's live.

### SEO & Performance Optimizations

- **Core Web Vitals** - Optimized for LCP < 1.5s, zero CLS, minimal FID
- **Semantic HTML** - Proper heading hierarchy, structured data (JSON-LD)
- **Open Graph & Twitter Cards** - Rich previews when shared on social media
- **GEO Distribution** - Cloudflare edge caching ensures fast load times globally
- **No render-blocking resources** - Inline critical CSS, no external stylesheets
- **Preconnect hints** - Early connection to required origins
- **Robots & AI-friendly** - Configured for search engines and AI crawlers (GPTBot, Claude-Web)

The entire site weighs under 50KB per page including all assets. No tracking scripts, no cookie banners, no third-party requests.
