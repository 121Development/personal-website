# What do you want?

![](/images/blog/what-do-you-want.webp)

It hit me the other day. My time now isn't spent on HOW to do things; it's spent on figuring out WHAT to actually do.

AI tools help with the how, but they require a clear plan; requirements, context, goal, end state, etc. Right down to the details. Better input means better output, or "shit in, shit out."

Whether I'm forming a strategy, researching, or coding, nailing the WHAT is where my focus is now.

Anyone else sharing the same thoughts?
