# Building a Modern Homepage with Astro

This is my first blog post about building a minimal, TypeScript-based homepage.

## Why Astro?

Astro is perfect for content-focused sites because:
- It's fast (ships minimal JavaScript)
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Great DX with component-based architecture
- SEO-friendly with SSR/SSG

## The Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro + TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Content**: Markdown files in the same repo
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

I'll be writing more about security, blockchain development, and system architecture.

Stay tuned!
