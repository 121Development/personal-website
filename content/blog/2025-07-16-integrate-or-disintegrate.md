# Integrate Or Disintegrate

![](/images/blog/integrate-process.webp)

Trust the process, or rather, integrate critical items into your systems so they can't be missed.

Humans fail. We miss things. It's in our nature.

To mitigate this, build those critical items into your systems or recurring processes. Let your systems handle and remind you of the essential items and tasks. Don't rely on a single individual with a checklist. Avoid single points of failure. Use push-pull for extra critical tasks.

**Integrate and trust the system.**
