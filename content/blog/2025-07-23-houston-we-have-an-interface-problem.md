# Houston we have an interface problem

![](/images/blog/houston-interface-problem.webp)

### The AI rocket has blasted off, but it's using a fraction of its capacity.

We live in a world designed for humans. Surprise! All our interfaces in the real and digital world are designed for us. For our eyes, ears and ten digits.

Our brain has immense power, and so does our digital devices. But the interface between these are our eyes, ears and our greasy fingers on the phone. **A severely limiting interface with a crippling low bitrate.**

Likewise our AI models are still confined to mostly working in a human first world. We have humanoid bots using tools made for us. Our systems like ERP, CRM etc. are not designed with any interface for AI. It's early days bolt on and hacked together interfaces where **powerful AI still clicks checkboxes and scrolls dropdown menus.**

Yet the capabilities of current AI continues to blow my mind. And then try to imagine a future with more capable AI that is fully compatible with all the things. Imagine what could be done

Most parts of the internet would be obsolete. Equipment and tools would look different. We would use voice, motion and neurological interfaces to interact straight with AI. No need for Windows or Mac OS. Systems and programs would talk directly to each other.

**The effectiveness and value gained from AI would skyrocket.**

MCP and A2A protocols are a first glimpse on what to expect when it comes to agent to agent and system communication. Neuralink is another humans to machine interface. We have a long way to go and a lot of system rewrites and new technology to build. But it will be done.

**This will accelerate fast. Strap in.**
