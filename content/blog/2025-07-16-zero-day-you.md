# Zero-Day You

![](/images/blog/zero-day-you.webp)

You are the weak link. You are the walking zero-day. You have a habit, a knowledge gap, a potential weakness that can be exploited.

Yes, you've patched your Windows installation, great, but when did you last patch yourself? When did you last learn something new or harden your own defenses? Have you reviewed your own vulnerabilities?

Evaluate your cybersecurity awareness and habits, your social engineering awareness, your public information, hobbies, and social circle — what information you share, with whom, and where.

**Patch yourself.**
