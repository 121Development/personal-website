# A thought from last week is the importance of understanding data

![](/images/blog/understanding-data.webp)

Knowledge work revolves around information or data. You aggregate, summarize, and derive insights from data. You structure data. You consume and create data. You retrieve and search for data and documents.

Yet, few people actually take the time to learn what data truly is. How is it stored? What is a relational database? How does a database retrieve data? What is a file? What is the difference between an "Int" and a "String"?

Taking a course on relational databases and data types should be mandatory. It changes the way you see and understand data. You gain insight into what happens behind the scenes and how data is processed. You become more efficient in your daily work with data. You structure your spreadsheets differently. You even learn how to prompt AI models more effectively.

**Do yourself a favor this year — take the time to learn about relational databases and data types!**
