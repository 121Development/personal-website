# Accelerate or die

What is e/acc? I've seen some people have it in their X bio, and others reference it in their posts. You probably have to?

e/acc = Effective Accelerationism. According to Wikipedia, it's a 21st-century philosophical movement that advocates for an explicitly pro-technology stance. Its proponents believe that unrestricted technological progress (especially driven by artificial intelligence) is a solution to universal human problems like poverty, war, and climate change. They see themselves as a counterweight to more cautious views on technological innovation, often labeling their opponents "doomers" or "decels" (short for decelerationists).

Here's my take: technology will continue to evolve, even if we try to regulate it. The potential gain from doing the research is too great to ignore, and some entity will always push the boundaries. Simple Game theory. It can't be stopped; if it can be invented, it will be. We'll have to deal with it, whether we like it or not. We're a curious species after all.

My biggest fear — and simultaneously my greatest private interest — is watching the development of AI. It could save us, or doom us. Or both. So I'm leaning in and hoping it turns out well. Let's see what happens…
