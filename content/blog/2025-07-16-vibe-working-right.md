# Vibe Working Right

![](/images/blog/vibe-work.webp)

Your AI payoff, the value you get from AI, starts from your current level of expertise in your field and with the tools you use.

New AI tools can make you *much* more effective! But don't switch off your brain and go into "all-in vibe work" mode. Don't hand all the work over to the tools. That can slow your skill-building and therefore your payoff and long-term potential.

These new digital training wheels make it easy to lean back. But you need to actively seek new knowledge about your field *and* about the tools. Try to understand the "why" and the underlying mechanisms. Understand the customer and the market better. Understand your own organization and sharpen your offering.

The goal is not to be dependent on the tools. They should simply help you reach results faster and more efficiently. The more you raise your own level, the more you'll get out of the tools.

So keep building your competence to get a better AI payoff!

**Happy vibe working!**
