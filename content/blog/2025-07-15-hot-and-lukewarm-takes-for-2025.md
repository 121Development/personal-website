# Hot (and lukewarm) takes for 2025!

*Repost from LinkedIn from January.*

Let's kickoff 2025 with a personal brain dump. What topics I find important and interesting. From security to health, AI and energy. Analysis not provided, but food for thought. Please share your take or comment below!

Increased division in society, factors such as the politicisation of everything, "good vs evil" portraying, cultural clashes, controversial policies etc.

Europe now mainly without core industry components and sustained energy production will se continued society unrest and turmoil in its chambers of leadership.

Geopolitical events will affect the global risk landscape, increased tensions, overt and covert operations and actions etc.

Less is more in government and bureaucracy, with Argentina showing the way and DOGE ready to go in the US.

Increased longevity focus within health industry, spearheaded by Bryan Johnsson and the don't die movement.

Birth rates globally will be a talking point, the west is mainly below replacement levels.

Energy demand from new AI/compute clusters will continue to outpace new capacity, scramble to build new capacity will continue; gas, solar, nuclear etc.

Nuclear energy continues it's renaissance, SMRs are the talk of the townExtreme weather will continue, but no one talks about the current polar shift and changing electromagnetic fields of earth as a potential factor.

AI teachers teach millions of students at zero cost Logic and reason will start to make a comeback.

Government will increase compute spend, and recognize it as a strategic resource, same with sustained energy production.

AI will continue to evolve, there is no ceiling.

Business impact from AI will be noticed, actual tasks will be automated, replacing white collar jobs.

Focus shifts from HOW to do things to WHAT to do, AI enables the doing, you focus on WHAT to accomplish with the doing. Clear goals and planning is key.

Software as a Service stalls and Service as Software takes more market share.

What else is missing?
